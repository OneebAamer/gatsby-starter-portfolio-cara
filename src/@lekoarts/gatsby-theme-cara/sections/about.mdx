## About

> I am a Computer Science student completing an MSci at King's College London.

So how did this all begin? I started off by programming plugins for a video game called Minecraft in PHP. These plugins modified the game to allow people to play the game differently. After a couple years of doing so, I became interested in game development. I began programming my own games in Unity written in C#, one of which I published recently on the Google Play Store. Eventually, I advanced towards more educational aspects of Computer Science, learning Python and Java along the way, and I decided that I wanted to pursue a career in Computer Science.
